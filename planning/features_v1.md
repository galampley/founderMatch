#### Who Are You — Technical
- List the functional disciplines where you have delivered end-to-end ownership (e.g., backend engineering, B2B sales, paid-ads growth, supply-chain ops). Link one result or artifact that proves each.
- What is your area/topic of interest in building a product/company?
- Describe the project where you first felt genuine flow in your craft—what problem were you solving, and what tools or methods unlocked it?
- What new domain, framework, or methodology are you determined to master in the next 12 months, and how will it strengthen your founder toolkit?

- Give your origin story in three sentences.
- Why start a company now? Rank these drivers in order of importance: impact, financial upside, craft challenge, autonomy.

- Choose three words that describe the culture you would build with your team.

#### Co-Founder Preferences — Technical
- Which functional areas must your co-founder lead so you can focus on your strengths?
- How open are you to pivoting product domain or business model if early signals flop?
- List the processes, toolchains, or methodologies that are absolute must-haves versus nice-to-haves for you (e.g., weekly pipeline reviews, design sprints, continuous delivery, OKRs).
- Specify the minimum daily time-zone overlap (hours) you need for synchronous work.
- What equity split feels fair if roles are equally senior? Choose 50/50, 60/40, or propose another ratio with reasoning.

#### Co-Founder Preferences — Personal
- How do you prefer feedback to be delivered: data-first, narrative-first, or direct bullet points?
- When decision-making is deadlocked, which resolution method do you lean toward: mediator advisor, rapid experiment, veto by designated lead, or coin flip?
- Outline your ideal weekly schedule (days, core hours, offline blocks, travel expectations).
- Describe the ten-year success headline that would make you say “we succeeded.”
- State your preferred exit horizon (profitably private, strategic acquisition, IPO) and why.
