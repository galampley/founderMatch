Primary problems
Larger firms are doing more with less so its harder to get hired than ever, esp for early career
Early stage hiring AND finding a cofounder is rooted in alignment / trust, which is scarce if just looking in immediate network
Hit rate for alignment / trust is low if looking outside immediate network
Early stage hiring is informal and disorganized (i.e. Twitter posting, large # of subs, poor culture/startup fit)
Matching in envs where alignment / trust are important sucks bc products don’t facilitate post-match (i.e. ‘dating’) -> matching alone is not enough data to rule on alignment / trust

Other problems
App process sucks…
100s of apps submitted; each sub takes time, esp when shape of apps is diff across hirers
Manually tracking subs and status via xlsx, GSheets etc
Current solutions don’t well service candidate who wants to pivot careers
No vis into app stage
Hiring, as an employer, sucks…
Large # of subs and poor matching/filtering 

Bet
# of new businesses, esp tech, is going to explode in AI age because…
Less time, resources and knowledge overhead req’d to build
Large firms are shrinking so less likely to hire
Solo founders are not endgame; always better to have partner/s w complimentary skills

Solution

Cofounding is P1?
Primary mobile; secondary web (PWA)
“Where trust, alignment, and context matter more than resumes.”

Considerations
Features
Showing rationale for a match can build trust
Formal collaboration trials (i.e. dates); out of the box frameworks and customizability; out of box more important for co-founders; customizability more important for early-stage
Endorsements
Psych analysis (i.e. MBTI)

Re: early-stage hirer, not just single player; what if two person team looking for a third? Match on both profiles? Create collective profile? 
How important is integration w existing internal tools (Lever, Workday)?
